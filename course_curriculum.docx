🐍 Learn Python in 4 Weeks!
A Hands-On Coding Journey for High Schoolers and under graduates

💡 Course Overview
Ever wondered how your favorite apps, games, or AI tools work? This 4-week Introduction to Python course is your gateway into the world of programming. You’ll start from the very basics and quickly advance to building your own projects — learning to code by doing, not memorizing. By the end, you’ll create your own mini software project using everything you’ve learned — a great addition to your academic portfolio!
📆 Week 1 – Getting Started with Python
Theme: From Zero to First Program
Goal: Understand what Python is, set up your environment, and write your first lines of code.
•	1. What is Python and why use it? - Learn where this language came from
•	2. Installing Python and an IDE. - Set up Python and a coding environment
•	3. Writing your first Python program. - Write and execute your first “Hello, World!”
•	4. Variables and data types. - Learn to store and manage data using variables
•	5. Basic input and output. - Use input() and print() to make your programs interactive and communicate with users.
💡 Mini Project: Create an “About Me” program that introduces you through Python code.
📆 Week 2 – Controlling the Flow
Theme: Logic, Loops, and Control
Goal: Learn to make decisions and repeat tasks efficiently.
•	1. Conditional statements – Use if, elif, and else to build decision-based logic.
•	2. Loops – Use for and while loops to repeat tasks automatically.
•	3. Lists and loops – Combine lists with loops for smart iteration.
•	4. Using Python libraries/modules – Import and use math, random, and other built-in modules.
•	5. Functions – Write reusable code blocks and understand parameters and return values.
🎮 Mini Project: Build a Number Guessing Game using loops and random numbers.
📆 Week 3 – Data Structures & Error Handling
Theme: Organize and Protect Data
Goal: Learn to store, access, and process data efficiently and safely.
•	1. Lists, tuples, and dictionaries – Store and retrieve multiple values easily.
•	2. Sets and frozen sets – Understand unique data collections.
•	3. String manipulation – Work with text using slicing, formatting, and functions.
•	4. File handling – Read from and write to text files.
•	5. Exception handling – Prevent program crashes using try, except, and finally.
📂 Mini Project: Create a Student Grade Tracker that saves data to a file.
📆 Week 4 – Objects & Final Project
Theme: Build Your Own Application
Goal: Apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and combine all prior knowledge into a project.
•	1. Introduction to OOP – Understand what classes and objects are.
•	2. Creating classes and objects – Build reusable templates for real-world entities.
•	3. Inheritance and polymorphism – Learn how to extend and customize behavior.
•	4. Debugging and testing – Fix errors and improve reliability.
•	5. Project showcase – Combine all skills into a creative final project.
